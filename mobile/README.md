# Mobile Application Boilerplate for Full Stack Assessment

This is intended to be used with the [Back End Boilerplate](https://github.com/Haut-Technologies/back-end-boilerplate) where `backEndURLBase` in `App.tsx` should be changed to the back end server's address. If you aren't running the back end server on the same machine as what you run `npm run schema` on then you'll also need to modify `package.json` appropriately.

## Quick start

Install docker and docker-compose

- For Debian based Linux distributions (includes Ubuntu):
  - `sudo apt install docker.io`
  - `sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
  - `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
  - To run `docker` and `docker-compose` without needing `sudo`: `sudo groupadd docker && sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. Then logout and login back in again to your computer.
- For MacOS:
  - `brew install --cask docker`
- For Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/

Then run the commands in the next sections within a Docker container by running

```sh
docker-compose build haut-rn
docker-compose run --service-ports --rm haut-rn
```

## Testing with Expo Go App

Install Expo Go app on a test device: https://expo.dev/client

## Setting up the back end

Clone [this repository](https://github.com/Haut-Technologies/back-end-boilerplate) and follow the instructions in the README. If running the back end on a different computer than the test device, you'll need to export the environment variable `BACK_END_URL` to an IP address of computer running the back end with the port number e.g. `export BACK_END_URL="172.30.1.12:3030"`.

Then run these commands

```sh
npm install # install project dependencies and generate code
npm start # start development server and test application using expo go mobile app
```

> Scanning the generated QR code through Expo Go on Android may not work so try to "Enter URL manually" by copying the URL printed by `npm start` e.g.
> `â€º Metro waiting on exp://ek-939.clearcharles.haut-rn.exp.direct:80`

## Using VSCode for Editing

The following extensions are used by the team:

- ESLint `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`
- GraphQL `GraphQL.vscode-graphql`
- Prettier - Code formatter `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
